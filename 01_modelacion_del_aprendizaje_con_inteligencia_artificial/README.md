# Modelaci√≥n del Aprendizaje con Inteligencia Artificial

## Description

This segment in the repository contains information about a class I
took in the university. This class was my first actual contact with
machine learning and artificial intelligence. Sadly, this class was
not very long, since it's a fairly new course in the university, and
I only took it once a week for 5 weeks. I learned a lot of things, 
including the basics of machine learning, models, and how to use
librares like `scikit-learn` and I delved into the basics of 
`tensorflow` and `keras`.

## A note from today

*This segment of the README.md should not be updated, as it is a
since it's the only part that I'm writing 3 days after the last day of
the first period of my semestre, aka. the last day of the last week of
the class.*

Date: March 18, 2024 - Hope you finally come back to this f***er.

Honestly, I usually take copilot's advice, even for writing the previous
paragraphs, but I'm going to write everything here myself. 

This class was amazing. It taught me so much about machine learning,
algorithms, and other things. My only regret is not paying attention
to the reinforced learning class. Since it was not going to be evaluated,
I took the opportunity to work on other classes projects.
This class was something I was looking forward to since the very first
day of class. When I read the title and the first contents of the modules
I thought it was a class about learning how to use LLM to our
advantage. Although this was an okay topic, it wasn't as interesting as 
the one we ended up taking. 

This class finally allowed me to interact with cool machine learning
models by using scikit-learn. This is what I always wanted to do, and
finally having an interaction with this, made me realize I'm on the right
path to what I want to do the rest of my life. I can finally understand
a lot of projects that I always wanted to do. How they work, the 
science behind them. We got to see topics like supervised ML and
unsupervised ML, and multiple models regarding each one. I finally
understand the different models there exists, when I should use one or
the other.

Honestly, I was starting to get worried, because the topic hadn't even
crossed my path so far in my career and thought I might have to look 
elsewhere to understand it. Although the class was very short and 
limited, I got the opportunity to work in many projects, with 2 final
projects which I intend to come back to when I get more experience.

## Projects

There are two projects in this segment of the repository. They can be 
found in `reto_1` and `reto_2`. Both projects are related to health
datasets, and they are about exploring 2 different machine learning
models each one. 

The first project uses supervised models, Random Forest Classifier and
K-Nearest Neighbors. 

The second project uses unsupervised models, K-Means and spectral
clustering.

If you wish to know more about these project, feel free to check them
out. The datasets are included in `data/raw` under this segment of the
repository.

## Notes

Although these projects can be executed, they require the use of
multiple libraries, including `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and
`matplotlib`. If you wish to execute them, you will need to install
these libraries. I will not provide a requirements file, because this is
more of an archive to me than a project. But don't worry, most 
modern IDEs will detect the libraries and install them for you.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy the projects. If I ever come 
back to this segment of the repository, I will update this
file with more information about the projects, and the class in general.

- BiXKu, peace out.
